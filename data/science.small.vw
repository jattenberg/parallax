guvax acc georgetown edu organization totally unorganized lines in article apr guvax acc georgetown edu denning guvax acc georgetown edu writes the following document summarizes the clipper chip how it is used how programming of the chip is coupled to key generation and the escrow process and how law enforcement decrypts communications interesting tell us what happens if i were to say ok i want to have something else if the law enforcement wants my traffic they can record it then get a search warrant and get the keys from me just like they would the keys to a stout private safe etc lets say i suspect that there is a way to trivially crack this at the fed level with no warrant say for nsa scanning for keywords etc and the government has abused great power in the past so i say mr vendor i want something different independent i am a paranoid sort ya understand will the result be sorry without government permission we cannot sell you anything secure or would it be sorry we know which side our bread is buttered on we cannot sell except to government people law enforcement and special people what in your opinion would be the chances of sure we will sell you this secure system be happy to also please be so kind as to tell us what the plans are for private encryption of say files transferred by modem or ftp or data stored on disk surely you have a feel for what the administration is planning for us people on that with your rather intimate relationship with the fbi nsa etc you must certainly have an idea you are surely not going to say the people are not to know until it is too late this is supposed to be government of the people by the people isn t it that is the people are the government s bosses the bosses want to know what the is going on here you see i am kind of nervous because in the last month or so i have seen a non stop stream of ideas coming out of wash dc that at least appear very strongly to have a common trait to limit privacy freedom from govt eavesdropping and the ability to defend ourselves against violent attack no is not good enough for common folk they arrive only in time to clean up the mess i would be dead if i had to depend on you see with all that talk about national smart id cards limiting of encryption to government approved denial of means to effective personal defense eight bills in congress right now it looks an awfully lot like the whole thing is to be able to trace every activity of an individual from cradle to grave all it would take is requiring that national id card to be used in all transactions and with no effective data protection and with the people suitably disarmed there would not be a helluva lot they could do about it now would there all in the name of the war on the constitu er drugs and of course that catch word terrorists what is wrong with good old fashioned police work to build a case they don t want to have to be burdened to leave the office it seems please read the bill of rights first ten amendments to the us constitution and tell us how you can reconcile this big brother ish policy of the administration always for a crisis of some kind isn t it with that bill of rights in the context of the people who wrote it reassure us please or is that no longer regarded as necessary seeing as apparantly the people have no input on this agenda the administration preferring to make all the decisions in secret then springing it on us doesn t sound much like by the people to me i cannot help notice that the congress people involved were not mentioned on the press release i find that more than a little bit curious don t you i sure would like to know who to not vote for come election time yes i am upset i feel you are a part of this because i recall it was you that was posting heavily in favor of a very similar idea could have been the same thing it was so close a few months ago i also recall it was not well received apparantly powers that be really didn t care or were not told or both from what i see clipper will only be useful for conversations i don t want the neighborhood kid listening in on any serious security i don t think i would want to trust it a bit might as well use cleartext certainly corporations would be rather dumb to depend on this for serious trade secret data especially if millions depended on that security given enough money one could buy any keys they wanted buy a crooked judge and a crooked cop given a few hundred thou they wouldn t be hard to find so we end up with only criminals terrorists and the government with real security and the ability to eavesdrop you know the first two if they are serious ain t going to use this thing for their communications i bet the government won t either except perhaps to order a pizza tell us will that be prima face evidence of criminal activity someone not using the government approved methods that just a desire to have privacy is no longer regarded as a legitimate right of an unconnected citizen will that be grounds for a fly through the door raid and confiscation of all one s equipment as terrorist tools using civil forfeiture so there will be no inconvenient need to prove any wrongdoing on the part of the citizen i have yet another question are we going to see articles in all the public magazines consisting of soothing text telling us how great this is how nice the government is by letting us have this illusion of privacy that the government is going to be so kind as to let us sort of exercise a right what you want to bet that i am correct here please answer these questions as citizens of the united states we hava a right to know what our government plans to let us have out of the goodness of their hearts funny thing though with all these proposals i don t feel one bit safer from drug dealers terrorists or a common street thug i am beginning to wonder if the greater danger lies in the above entities or our own government gone out of

graphics ok with all the discussion about observed playback speeds with quicktime the effects of scaling and so on i thought i d do some more tests first of all i felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than realistic the movie i had been using only had frames in it it was a version of the very first movie i created with the compact video compressor i decided something a little longer would give closer to real world results for better or for worse i pulled out a copy of a space odyssey that i had recorded off tv a while back about fifteen minutes into the movie there s a sequence where the earth shuttle is approaching the space station specifically i digitized a portion of about seconds duration zooming in on the rotating space station i figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between frames to increase the differences between frames i digitized it at only frames per second to give a total of frames i captured the raw footage at a resolution of pixels with the spigot card in my centris quarter size resolution from a pal source i then imported it into premiere and put it through the compact video compressor keeping the fps frame rate i created two versions of the movie one scaled to resolution the other at resolution i used the default quality setting in premiere and specified a key frame every ten frames i then ran the movie through the same raw speed test program i used for the results i d been reporting earlier result a playback rate of over frames per second that s right i was getting a much higher result than with that first short test movie just for fun i copied the movie to my external hard disk a quantum lp s and ran it from there this time the playback rate was only about frames per second obviously the mb internal hard disk also a quantum is a significant contributor to the speed of playback i modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional scaling factors and tried playing back the movie scaled to size this time the playback speed was over fps clearly the poster who observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing quicktime in action not i d try my tests with quicktime but i don t think it s entirely compatible with my centris and system unscaled the playback rate for the movie was over fps the other thing i tried was saving versions of the movie with preferred playback rates greater than and seeing how well they played from within movieplayer ie with quicktime s normal synchronized playback a preferred rate of fps didn t work too well the playback was very jerky compare this with the raw speed test which achieved fps with ease i can t believe that quicktime s synchronization code would add this much overhead i think the slowdown was coming from the mac system s task switching a preferred rate of fps seemed to work fine i couldn t see any evidence of stutter at fps i think i could see slight stutter but with four key frames every second it was hard to tell i guess i could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the key frames to make the stutter more noticeable of course this will also improve the compression slightly which should speed up the playback performance even more lawrence d oliveiro fone computer services dept fax university of waikato electric mail ldo waikato ac nz hamilton new zealand s e gmt i m afraid i missed the start of this thread but there are three factors that can significantly affect quicktime s playback speed that you may want to take into account playback bit depth things are fastest when you play a movie back at the bit depth it was compressed for this is usually or bit but other depths are of course possible type of scaling qt is optimized for double size scaling other scaling factors hit peformance much harder playback window position movieplayer limits your window placement choices to advantagous pixel boundaries by default i m not sure about premiere any combination of those can radically alter playback performance image size is of course another biggie giving the movie player lots of ram can also make a real difference forgive me if these were mentioned earlier in the thread

loral com organization loral rolm computer systems date thu apr gmt lines from denning the skipjack encryption algorithm f an bit family key that is common to all chips n a bit serial number u an bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip e m k the encrypted message stream and e e k u n f a law enforcement block where the session key is k and is transmitted encrypted in the unit key u which along with the serial number n is encrypted in the family key f presumably the protocol can be recovered if by nothing else differential analysis postulate if you will a chip or logic sitting between the clipper chip and its communications channel the function of this spoof chip is twofold transmit channel the spoof chip xors the bit encrypted serial number with a secondary keying variable this renders the serial number unrecoverable with just the family key receive channel the spoof chip xors the incoming encrypted serial number with a secondary keying variable assuming integrity of the law enforcement block is necessary for local operation checksums sequence control etc this has the net result of hiding the serial number it is probable theere is a known plaintext pattern used as a filler in the block containing n bits as used in generating u u u correctness of the law enforcement block can be determined with only the family key f whereas no one has proposed federal agencies be denied f and because they could recover it themselves the correctness of the serial number can be tested by examining the pad bits of n in e n f the one could selectively alter the law enforcement block as above but the mutilation could be detected a better approach would be to mutilate the entire law enforcement block if it were done with a group encryption scheme such as des or presumably skipjack the chances the law enforcement block can be recovered are lessened what do you want to bet the transmission protocol can be recognized and the serial numbers decrypted in a target search when digital transmission becomes widely available would there be a requirement that clipper protocol transmissions be refused when containing mutilated law enforcement blocks one way to avoid notice would be to spoof protocol information of the block containing m as well as spoofing the law enforcement block the goal is to use a secure communications scheme without redress to detection or key k interception contained encrypted within the law enforcement block the data stream is returned to its original state for use by the clipper chip or system if required for proper operation it is somewhat improbable that the entire protocol will be contained within the clipper chip yet likely that sequence of events will be tested for requiring a valid law enforcement block to be received before accepting and decrypting e m k the spoof chip could be implemented anywhere in the protocols including on the resulting serial data stream existing clipper products could be subborned after all they are high security encryption systems right super encipherment encryption could allow the chip to be used without redress to detection of the use of the chip or disclosure of the serial number security must be adequate to deny the serial number which should not be recoverable by other means one can see the use of cut outs for procurring clipper phones or once the number of units is high enough stealing them it would be a mistake on the part of authority but nice from a point of privacy if the serial number n were not associated with a particular clipper chip or lot of chips through the manufacturing and distribution process hopefully the list of known missing or stolen clipper serial numbers n encrypted with f and the protocols are not sufficient plaintext to attact the super encrypted clipper stream this could be further made difficult by altering the temporal and or spatial relationship of the clipper stream to that of the super encrypted stream detection of an encrypted stream could tip off the use of the aforementioned scheme if you could capture valid law enforcement blocks not your own and use them in a codebook sustitution with your own where they point to a valid law enforcement block stored in a library utilizing a session key matching the remainder of the transmission you could simply out and out lie yet deliver to monitoring and or hostile forces a seemingly valid law enforcement block these captured law enforcement blocks would be used as authenticators such as in a manually keyed encryption system fending this off would require escalation in examining the protocols and blocks in the transmission the m code stream might be independently attacked based on knowledge of clipper chip protocols as revealed plaintext this could be invalidated by changing the temporal and or spatial relationship of the clipper m stream and the actual transmitted stream under the control of a secure key generator synchronized between endpoints the useful life time of captured law enforcement blocks might be limited based on hostile forces using them as targets following transmission interception you would need a large number of them but hey there s supposed to be millions of these things right adding time stamps to the encrypted law enforcement block is probably impractical who wants an encryption chip with a real time clock the entire idea of the law enforcement block can be invalidated

apr clarinet com brad clarinet com brad templeton writes in article tcmay netcom com timothy c may writes getting the court order to reveal the key also makes decipherable all past conversations which may be on tape or disk or whatver as i understand the proposal i could be wrong but i ve seen no mention of session keys being the escrowed entities true in theory in practice the technology of cellular phones will probably be spread spectrum and quite difficult to record the crypttext without the key if the frequency path depends on they key as i understand it to it could be made effectively impossible to record i am not an expert in the cryptography science but some basic things seem evident to me things which this clinton clipper do not address the all pertain to opportunites for abuse and conclusions based on what i have seen the membership of this group except for two notable persons agree to if anything bad is possible by the government in theory it almost always ends up happening in fact so the key is to make abuse impossible question authority and remember power does corrupt i think one has to regard this whole idea in the sense that it will be expanded to include other data forms such as data transfer and stored data and as such should be treated as if it were expanded or such expansion will be almost impossible to stop using clipper as a precident there was a hint of that in the proposal remember that said please bear with me i am not very articulate so i take more words to say what others could say much more briefly thank you once it hits land you can record it if you have telco access the telco isn t supposed to give that without a warrant that s the rule today as i suggested this is now the hint is in the proposal that this or similar proposals are being considered for other forms of encryptions such as data transfer data files and such largely dependent on how this thing is accepted or flies i think one would be wise to treat this in the manner one would when not if it gets expanded to other areas than cellular phones i think this is guaranteed to happen if this proposal gets by salami politics it has been and is used in several other areas it is certain to be used here government is not going to easily give up on the idea that they should be able to eavesedrop whenever they want to court order required has proven to be a rather flimsy guarantee if the case warrants they can always sieze the material and force one to give the key or sit in jail forever on periodically renewed contempt charges so it is not denying the justice system the information nor the ability to lock someone up if guilty or refuses to divulge the means to access the info this is not protected under the fifth one can be forced to perform acts that would result in divulging incriminating evidence so blocking restrictions on private encryption is not preventing legitimate law enforcement it does make illegitimate law enforcement a bunch more difficult especially fishing expeditions without the target s knowlege don t give up the right to be safe from that that should be non negotiable and clinton and co know it which is probably why they quietly developed this thing figuring if they get it this far they can ram it on through how come those consulted could be roughly described as us insiders they cannot quietely impliment it though when they ban other schemes to ensure its exclusive use hence the nice pr document to try and reassure everyone don t buy into it has government really earned that kind of trust past or future to be secure and free one must keep government honest and the only way to do that is to make abuse impossible not unlikely or difficult but even so the evidence would not be admissible i think unless the judge so ordered i think that even interception of the crypttext without a warrant would be illegal cops can t record today s plain cellular calls and then ask a judge hey can we have permission to listen to those tapes can they so what one could use information gained by re use of the keys saved after the last case was finished or other means master key backdoor easily broken algorithm to find other evidence which given to a judge would authorize a tap which wouldn t have been possible otherwise this has been the more common manner of abuse of wiretaps in the past for local cops this might be workable to keep them honest but the feds have a workaround somehow bet on it does anyone really believe for example that the government will use a scheme nsa cannot listen in on scanning for keywords either easily defeated in realtime or via a master key i sure don t this whole thing sounds like something to eliminate the need to use old fashioned police work to build a case in the past eavesdropping was rather easy with or without a court order i think the law enforcement community has become a bit spoiled and will resist changes that require them to revert to using old fashioned detective work i just find it somewhat surprising coming from a bunch that cares so much about civil and individual rights that puts people first the question is put people first to where with the innards not being revealed how is one to be sure there doesn t exist a master key for use by nsa etc so they can do their keyword scan etc on conversations they routinely monitor without a specific court order remember the cellular phone limitiation is only temporary bet on it and so far i have not heard about police telling people that they have been tapped and nothing incriminating was found what is to keep them from simply keeping the keys on file for next time after awhile they would have quite a collection kept especially for folks they deem disruptive and if they get only one key that would reduce the search space a lot unless it is an rsa scheme remember nixon years need for court orders really slowed them down didn t it and unless the escrow accounts are not government controlled fat chance i see one ending up being under say treasury the other under justice it could be worth some serious bucks to some folks to get keys to a competitor s clinton clipper or descendent when this idea is expanded to be used for all non government encryption enough bucks would get one the keys or the innards for this algorithm perhaps not an important concern but given past government behavior and the other problems worse of course if the government then uses this clinton clipper to argue for restrictions on unapproved encryption this is the main concern of most of us i think the camel s nose in the tent etc yes that is a major concern but i think that they think they can win just by having of the usa use this system they don t even have to care about the cautious that s left they don t catch the really smart crooks anyway john gotti who would have to be retarded not to realize he was likely to be wiretapped glibly chatted away on his tapped phone about murder plans that s why he s in jail now hard to believe but true what will one do when it is expanded to data storage encryption you can bet that if clipper is accepted that will be next on the agenda it is even hinted at in the proposal read it carefully expect the argumet well if you got nothing to hide fine then using that argument one should not object to video cameras being installed in every room of one s home granted an exteme expansion of the idea but the principle holds private stuff should remain private even from a govt fishing expedition and laws rules may change in the future as to safeguards when it comes to the fed government safeguards are pretty meaningless if they want to do get something don t work so hard to give up some rather treasured rights or establish bad precidents please the price could be hell to pay later this scheme can succeed without laws forbidding more which people would fight a lot harder they like this enough that they are dropping the so called digital telephony proposal according to rumours however the meaning of that is complex since they still want to get at the crypttext on telco systems and that requires a bit of work people would fight laws forbidding more now but in say two years because we have this crisis situation which must be addressed by some drastic action just this added reasonable restriction will only bother those who have someting to hide etc please don t buy into it if the clinton clipper is so very good why not make its algrithm public so many people can exchange ideas and examine it rather than a few isolated respected experts respected by whom for what perhaps a certain professor who likes key banks would be one of the selected experts this does seem to expand on some ideas the person was advocating if i recall how would anybody know that what the experts examine is the same as what will end up being used in the clipper chip if it is kept secret perhaps the clipper will use a crippled version with a master key provision or features not present in the version subjected for study and evaluation by the experts and who chooses the expertes the government no conflict of interest there and isn t it a requirement for any decent encryption scheme that it not have its effectiveness reduced by having the algrorithm widely known i was lead to believe that one should assume the other side has everything you have except for the key s i recall ideas presented to this group are rejected if a requirement exists the algorithm be secret another question since it is a safe bet this clipper thing would not be used for government security they are regarding it as not real secure but good enough for common folk i think i would like to see a full description not a pr non statement of just what good enough means i think when saying how strong it is good enough really means not very the excuse that other countries have these restrictions is not acceptable other countries do not have our bill of rights and constitution which the people not the governments of those other countries often regard with envy what we have as rights they have as revokable privileges and if we expect to retain those rights and protections we must not allow them to be gutted because we just gotta have this thing to fight crime we have allready have our bill of rights pretty much torn to shreds we should not permit more weakining for yet another noble cause instead we should be trying to repair the damage our crime problem may have a number of causes but too many rights and safeguards is not a signifigant one a broken court system and poor police work are a much more signifigant cause as having too many rights disregarding addressing the root causes for crime etc btw those who suggest that this is just an attack on clinton believe this i would be going ballistic reagardless who seriously proposed this thing it is just another step in a gradual erosion of our rights under the constitution or bill of rights the last couple of decades have been a non stop series of end runs around the protections of the constitution it has to stop now is as good a time as

clipper chip announcement subject white house public encryption management fact sheet message id sender news dove nist gov organization national institute of standards technology distribution na date fri apr gmt lines note the following was released by the white house today in conjunction with the announcement of the clipper chip encryption technology fact sheet public encryption management the president has approved a directive on public encryption management the directive provides for the following advanced telecommunications and commercially available encryption are part of a wave of new computer and communications technology encryption products scramble information to protect the privacy of communications and data by preventing unauthorized access advanced telecommunications systems use digital technology to rapidly and precisely handle a high volume of communications these advanced telecommunications systems are integral to the infrastructure needed to ensure economic competitiveness in the information age despite its benefits new communications technology can also frustrate lawful government electronic surveillance sophisticated encryption can have this effect in the united states when exported abroad it can be used to thwart foreign intelligence activities critical to our national interests in the past it has been possible to preserve a government capability to conduct electronic surveillance in furtherance of legitimate law enforcement and national security interests while at the same time protecting the privacy and civil liberties of all citizens as encryption technology improves doing so will require new innovative approaches in the area of communications encryption the u s government has developed a microcircuit that not only provides privacy through encryption that is substantially more robust than the current government standard but also permits escrowing of the keys needed to unlock the encryption the system for the escrowing of keys will allow the government to gain access to encrypted information only with appropriate legal authorization to assist law enforcement and other government agencies to collect and decrypt under legal authority electronically transmitted information i hereby direct the following action to be taken installation of government developed microcircuits the attorney general of the united states or her representative shall request manufacturers of communications hardware which incorporates encryption to install the u s government developed key escrow microcircuits in their products the fact of law enforcement access to the escrowed keys will not be concealed from the american public all appropriate steps shall be taken to ensure that any existing or future versions of the key escrow microcircuit are made widely available to u s communications hardware manufacturers consistent with the need to ensure the security of the key escrow system in making this decision i do not intend to prevent the private sector from developing or the government from approving other microcircuits or algorithms that are equally effective in assuring both privacy and a secure key escrow system key escrow the attorney general shall make all arrangements with appropriate entities to hold the keys for the key escrow microcircuits installed in communications equipment in each case the key holder must agree to strict security procedures to prevent unauthorized release of the keys the keys shall be released only to government agencies that have established their authority to acquire the content of those communications that have been encrypted by devices containing the microcircuits the attorney general shall review for legal sufficiency the procedures by which an agency establishes its authority to acquire the content of such communications procurement and use of encryption devices the secretary of commerce in consultation with other appropriate u s agencies shall initiate a process to write standards to facilitate the procurement and use of encryption devices fitted with key escrow microcircuits in federal communications systems that process sensitive but unclassified information i expect this process to proceed on a schedule that will permit promulgation of a final standard within six months of this directive the attorney general will procure and utilize encryption devices to the extent needed to preserve the government s ability to conduct lawful electronic surveillance and to fulfill the need for secure law enforcement communications further the attorney general shall utilize funds from the department of justice asset forfeiture super surplus fund to effect this purchase

bundled with a device called the toaster from newtek inc that operates on an amiga platform the lightwave software lightwave lightwave d and lightwave modeler allows and artist to create three dimensional photo realistic images for a variety of purposes why are we doing this this mailing list is for those interested in the lightwave software how it operates and in ideas on how to obtain the best quality images available to them the list is for those who own the toaster and lightwave as well as those just interested in what can be done with the package we hope to share information tips procedures and to bond as a group what are the rules since lightwave modeler are just a part of the newtek video toaster software i m sure we will discuss a few items related to the operation of the toaster however we will strive to keep the subject revolving specifically around the d software related tools and products you do not have to own a toaster to join this list ok how do i join to become a member of the lightwave d mailing list you must send a mail message to the address lightwave request bobsbox rent com in the body of the message enter subscribe lightwave l your name your site

too much of a delay in joining expect a welcome message within days after you send your request then expect the mail to start flowing in how do i post to the list contributing to the list is simple just mail your articles to the following address lightwave bobsbox rent com your article will be processed by the system and distributed to all others joined to the list your articles will also be sent to you so you know that your article has made it to the list however those addresses that are either no good or no longer active will bounce back to you so if you post an article and another

des what is differential cryptanalysis how was nsa involved in the design of des is des available in software is des available in hardware can des be used to protect classified information what are ecb cbc cfb and ofb encryption what is a product cipher a product cipher is a block cipher that iterates several weak operations such as substitution transposition modular addition multiplication and linear transformation a block cipher just means a cipher that encrypts a block of data bytes say all at once then goes on to the next block the notion of product ciphers is due to shannon sha examples of modern product ciphers include lucifer sor des nbs sp networks kam loki bro feal shi pes lai khufu and khafre me a the so called feistel ciphers are a class of product ciphers which operate on one half of the ciphertext at each round and then swap the ciphertext halves after each round lucifer des loki and feal are examples of feistel ciphers the following table compares the main parameters of several product ciphers cipher block length key bits number of rounds lucifer des loki feal x x pes what makes a product cipher secure nobody knows how to prove mathematically that a product cipher is completely secure so in practice one begins by demonstrating that the cipher looks highly random for example the cipher must be nonlinear and it must produce ciphertext which functionally depends on every bit of the plaintext and the key meyer mey has shown that at least rounds of des are required to guarantee such a dependence in this sense a product cipher should act as a mixing function which combines the plaintext key and ciphertext in a complex nonlinear fashion the fixed per round substitutions of the product cipher are referred to as s boxes for example lucifer has s boxes and des has s boxes the nonlinearity of a product cipher reduces to a careful design of these s boxes a list of partial design criteria for the s boxes of des which apply to s boxes in general may be found in brown bro and brickell et al bri what are some group theoretic properties of product ciphers let e be a product cipher that maps n bit blocks to n bit blocks let e k x be the encryption of x under key k then for any fixed k the map sending x to e k x is a permutation of the set of n bit blocks denote this permutation by p k the set of all n bit permutations is called the symmetric group and is written s n the collection of all these permutations p k where k ranges over all possible keys is denoted e s n if e were a random mapping from plaintexts to ciphertexts then we would expect e s n to generate a large subset of s n coppersmith and grossman cop have shown that a very simple product cipher can generate the alternating group a n given a sufficient number of rounds the alternating group is half of the symmetric group it consists of all even permutations i e all permutations which can be written as an even number of swaps even and goldreich eve were able to extend these results to show that feistel ciphers can generate a n given a sufficient number of rounds the security of multiple encipherment also depends on the group theoretic properties of a cipher multiple encipherment is an extension over single encipherment if for keys k k there does not exist a third key k such that e k e k x e k x which indicates that encrypting twice with two independent keys k k is equal to a single encryption under the third key k if for every k k there exists a k such that eq is true then we say that e is a group this question of whether des is a group under this definition was extensively studied by sherman kaliski and rivest she in their paper they give strong evidence for the hypothesis that des is not a group in fact des is not a group cam what can be proven about the security of a product cipher recall from above that p k is a permutation produced by e under some key k the goal of the designer of e is to ensure that p k appears to be a random element of s n the symmetric group let r be an element of s n selected randomly we will say that p k and r are indistinguishable if an observer given p k and r in some order cannot distinguish between these two permutations in polynomial time that is with time bounded resources the observer cannot determine which of the permutations is produced by e the optimal decision is no better than simply guessing luby and rackoff lub have shown that a class of feistel ciphers are secure in this sense when the round mapping is replaced by random boolean functions how are block ciphers used to encrypt data longer than the block size there are four standard modes of operation and numerous non standard ones as well the standard modes of operation are defined in the u s department of commerce federal information processing standard fips published in see the question about ecb below for more details although they are defined for the des block cipher the modes of operation can be used with any block cipher can symmetric block ciphers be used for message authentication one may use a symmetric cryptosystem block cipher to prove to himself that he did or did not generate a message and to prove to himself whether his message was altered or unaltered since generation but one cannot prove these things to another without revealing the key and thereafter that key cannot be used to prove anything about any messages that were authenticated using that key see ansi x and fips for a standard method of message authentication using des what exactly is des des is the u s government s data encryption standard a product cipher that operates on bit blocks of data using a bit key it is defined in fips which supersedes fips fips are federal information processing standards published by ntis des is identical to the ansi standard data encryption algorithm dea defined in ansi x what is triple des triple des is a product cipher which like des operates on bit data blocks there are several forms each of which uses the des cipher times some forms use two bit keys some use three the des modes of operation may also be used with triple des some people refer to e k d k e k x as triple des this method is defined in chapter of the ansi standard x financial institution key management and is intended for use in encrypting des keys and ivs for automated key distribution its formal name is encryption and decryption of a single key by a key pair but it is referenced in other standards documents as ede that standard says section key encrypting keys may be a single dea key or a dea key pair key pairs shoud be used where additional security is needed e g the data protected by the key s has a long security life a key pair shall not be encrypted or decrypted using a single key others use the term triple des for e k d k e k x or e k e k e k x one of us carl ellison keeps advocating des triple use in the form e k tran e k tran e k compress x where each des instance has its own key and iv for cbc mode and tran has been posted on sci crypt it is a large block transposition program taking its key from the data stream itself so that it is not an encryption program on its own part what is differential cryptanalysis differential cryptanalysis is a statistical attack that can be applied to any iterated mapping ie any mapping which is based on a repeated round function the method was recently popularized by biham and shamir bih but coppersmith has remarked that the s boxes of des were optimized against this attack some years ago this method has proved effective against several product ciphers notably feal bi a differential cryptanalysis is based on observing a large number of ciphertexts y y whose corresponding plaintexts x x satisfy a known difference d x x where is componentwise xor in the basic biham shamir attack such plaintext pairs are required to determine the key for des substantially fewer pairs are required if des is truncated to or rounds in these cases the actual key can be recovered in a matter of minutes using a few thousand pairs for full des this attack is impractical because it requires so many known plaintexts the work of biham and shamir on des revealed several startling observations on the algorithm most importantly if the key schedule was removed from des and a bit key was used the key could be recovered in less than steps thus independent subkeys do not add substantial security to des further the s boxes of des are extremely sensitive in that changing even single entries in these tables yields significant improvement in the differential attack adi shamir is quoted to say nytimes oct i would say that contrary to what some people believe there is no evidence of tampering with the des so that the basic design was weakened how was nsa involved in the design of des according to kinnucan kin tuchman a member of the group that developed des at ibm is quoted as saying we developed the des algorithm entirely within ibm using ibmers the nsa did not dictate a single wire tuchman and meyer another developer of des spent a year breaking ciphers and finding weaknesses in lucifer they then spent two years strengthening lucifer their basic approach was to look for strong substitution permutation and key scheduling functions ibm has classified the notes containing the selection criteria at the request of the nsa the nsa told us we had inadvertently reinvented some of the deep secrets it uses to make its own algorithms explains tuchman on the other hand a document called involvement of the nsa in the development of des unclassified summary of the united states select committee on intelligence printed in the ieee communications magazine p states in the development of des nsa convinced ibm that a reduced keysize was sufficient indirectly assisted in the development of the s box structures and certified that the final des algorithm was to the best of their knowledge free from any statistical or mathematical weakness clearly the key size was reduced at the insistence of the nsa the article further states that the nsa did not tamper with the algorithm itself just the parameters which in some sense resolves the apparent conflict in the remarks of meyer and tuchman presented above is des available in software several people have made des code available via ftp see part for pathnames stig ostholm ftpso bsd ftpbk eric young ftpey dennis furguson ftpdf mark riordan ftpmr phil karn ftppk a pascal listing of des is also given in patterson pat fips says the algorithm specified in this standard is to be implemented using hardware not software technology software implementations in general purpose computers are not in compliance with this standard despite this software implementations abound and are used by government agencies is des available in hardware the following paragraphs are quoted from messages sent to the editors we don t vouch for the quality or even existence of the products chip

establishments they can be reached at can des be used to protect classified information des is not intended to protect classified data fips says this standard will be used by federal departments and agencies for the cryptographic protection of computer data when the following conditions apply cryptographic protection is required and the data is not classified according to the national security act of as amended or the atomic energy act of as amended what are ecb cbc cfb and ofb encryption these are methods for using block ciphers such as des to encrypt messages files and blocks of data known as modes of operation four modes of operation are defined in fips december and also in ansi x fips specifies that when bit ascii data is sent in octets the unused most significant bit is to be set to fips also specifies the padding for short blocks the four des modes of operation are electronic code book ecb cipher block chaining cbc k bit cipher feedback cfb and k bit output feedback ofb these methods are explained below in a c language like notation some symbols p n the n th block of plaintext input to encryption output from decryption size of block determined by the mode c n the n

laboratory distribution world date fri apr gmt lines begin pgp signed message gasp i ve just spent hours catching up on sci crypt here slow reader i guess and i really have to put out a few comments too first let me flame the famous dave s he s obviously only years old cut him some slack the joke about clinton crypto drugs slammed me thru the roof nice job guys i ve been working on marijuana legalization for over years now clinton s actions so far have really helped but because of government action taken against various other groups i have developed a bit des based on public literature to protect my mailing list the s boxes are the critical component and since i chose out of based on the key cracking this des is going to tough the reason it slows you down a touch is that for each key you try you need to use a different set of s boxes i know it s only a vector but it sure makes random search a pain several marijuana legalization groups have had their mailing lists confiscated when people were charged with drug use sales it s not a crime to be a member of a legalization org but you will be watched it really is important to write a letter to every official you personally vote for to explain why your privacy is being destroyed by the cripple chip amazingly enough they do listen when they get enough mail the doonsbery jokes about nra postcards are real and the imi illinois marijuana initiative has grown to the point where we are seeing some changes it s pretty clear that all the hullabaloo is really about the implimentation decision being made behind our backs as vesselin points out this was common practice in communist regimes and may be again depending on how the vote goes but just as criminals have guns and law abiding citizens don t and criminals like me have marijuana and law abiding subjects don t criminals like me will have secure crypto while law abiding robots don t pgp is nice but as time goes on we all can do better and to save our hides we will someone posted an excerpt from machiavelli he s my favorite dude years ago he saw clearly how people are and tried to explain that to princes who wanted people to obey one section not quoted i ve got the prince at home so i ll just paraphrase had to do with conquring a free city the only way is to completly destroy it failing that you must appoint locals to high positions and accept the people s customs even after years of oppression a people will remember their heratige and rise up to overthrow the oppresive government and he gave an example and that was years before thomas jefferson there were questions about watching traffic only interesting traffic is watched stuff that goes overseas and comes back stuff with keywords like marijauana cryptography nsa certain individuals who are known subversives etc it is easy enough to store all that traffic so if you know how to be subversive i e how to be unseen it s pretty easy to go unnoticed for a long time the stronger your crypto system and the less you re noticed the better your chances of developing an organization which can diseminate truth to the masses which gets me to the thread about a public encrypted conference that s just silly the first thing the feds do is send in an infiltrator like dave s and they know what you re doing it will be fun for teenagers and college students but for the real world it s pretty pointless crypto is useful for more things than hiding where you get your marijuana guns drugs and crypto do have some commonality there are people in government who want you to obey their rules as lundquist says in alt drugs live free or don t machiavelli pointed out that s just how most people actually live inspite of appearences to the contrary it s true that the decision to shove the clipper not the same thing as intergraph s down our throats violates the principles of what the u s was founded on but the government is full of idiotic robots called bureaucrats and there s less to worry about than one might think only really innocent read naive subjects of the u s will be hurt by this the rest of us criminals will live in secure freedom de toqueville pointed out years ago that the tyranny of the majority will be mitigated by the mediocrity of the government and given what i see government officials doing where i work argonne national lab the level of stupidity makes dave s look smart
